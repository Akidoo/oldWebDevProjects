      <p>OurFinals is an initiative that intends to change the game when it comes to online tuitions, by having everything be on demand. The basic idea of the startup is that it is an online community for University students where they can have on demand classes for certain topics that they may be struggling with. The product follows a model similar to grab’s, in the sense that classes can be booked from anytime, anywhere.<br>
<br>
        The fun part? <br>
<br>
        With OurFinals, you can be both a student AND a teacher! <br>
<br>
        The "teachers" on OurFinals may be actual teachers looking to earn some extra money, or uni students (who are particularly good at the topic, of course!) looking to make some pocket money.
