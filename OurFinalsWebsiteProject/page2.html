      <p> OurFinals was an idea thought up by Aditya Banerjee, Robin Chua, and Arnav Sharma. The startup was really made possible by the NUS incubator program as it served as a great stepping stool for the trio to get their idea noticed, and have some really intelligent peple give them feedback on their idea. There are many aspiring Startup Founders attempting to provide a convenient solution for various everyday problems, However, even if they have a good business model, it is difficult for the startup to kick off due to lack of funding, or because the team simply does not have enough reach, or even the fact that there are so many new, interesting startups that having something to make your product stand out is crucial. The incubator program really helps get some breathing room in that respect, as you don't have to constantly worry about maing good connections. <br><br>
