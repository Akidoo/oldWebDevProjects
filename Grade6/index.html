<p>Being kind is important for various reasons. It helps build good relationships <br>with others, people will like you more. Aiden Spencer states that “Finding out <br>what kindness is first is a good start, if people are kind to one another, there <br>is no reason to be unkind to one another.” Recent scientific evidence also suggests<br> that being kind positively affects the happiness and mental health of a person. <br>Spencer also claims that being kind is very similar to an act of selfishness, and <br>it is good to be selfish to a certain extent. Furthermore, Spencer says that the<br> world has made a lot of progress with being kind since World War 2, but there <br>is still plenty of room for improvement.</p><br>

<p><small><small>The peace symbol can also serve as a symbol of kindness.</small></small></p><br><br>

<p> Being kind isn't only limited to being kind to each other. There are plenty of ways on which you<br> can be kind to the environment, such as participating in a beach cleanup, Recycling items, and<br> binning litter. It is important to be kind to and care for our environment because all creatures<br> will die if we don't. Even if nobody is hosting a beach cleanup near you, it is very easy to do one on<br> your own. Just grab a few garbage bags and a pair of tongs and set off to a nearby beach!<br><br><br><br>

<h4>What you can do</h4>
<p id="What you can do">There are many things you can do. You can set little objectives <br>for yourself, like going a week without using plastic products. You<br> could also go for a scavenger hunt with your friends, but the objective <br>is to recycle as many objects as possible. It's even better that way,<br>because you don't need to set up the items, because they are garbage.<br> As for the No plastic for a week goal, you could use, for example, glass <br>and wood products, however, refrain from using too many wood products<br> as more trees will die, and that isn't being kind to nature. You could also<br> set a challenge for yourself where you have to participate in a <br>certain amount of cleanups of beaches, streets, etc.</p>
